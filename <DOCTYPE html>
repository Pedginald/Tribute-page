   <h2 id="subheading">Timeline of Jesse Livermore's life"</h2>

   <p id="tribute-info">
     <ul>
       <li>Jesse Lauriston Livermore was born in Acton, Massachusetts, on the 26th July, 1877.
       He had a poverty striken childhood, in which he grew up on the family farm, and attended
       school until the age of 14, when his father made him quit.</li>
       <li>He ran away from home and got a job at a stock brockerage firm in Boston, called Paine Webber,
       where he made $5 a week.</li>
       <li>At the tender age of 16, he found success in trading stocks by reading the ticker tape.
       He was able to earn a whopping $10,000 dollars, which in the late 1800's, was indeed, a fortune.</li>
       <li>He unfortunately lost this fortune when he tried to play the Wall Street market, a few years
       later. However, he then moved to St. Louis and was able to build his fortune back in the sketchy bucket
       shops.</li>
