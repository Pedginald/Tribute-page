   <h2 id="subheading">Events of Jesse Livermore's life"</h2>

   <p id="tribute-info">
     <ul>
       <li>Jesse Lauriston Livermore was born in Acton, Massachusetts, on the 26th July, 1877.
       He had a poverty striken childhood, in which he grew up on the family farm, and attended
       school until the age of 14, when his father made him quit.</li>
       <li>He ran away from home and got a job at a stock brockerage firm in Boston, called Paine Webber,
       where he made $5 a week.</li>
       <li>At the tender age of 16, he found success in trading stocks by reading the ticker tape.
       He was able to earn a whopping $10,000 dollars, which in the late 1800's, was indeed, a fortune.</li>
       <li>He unfortunately lost this fortune when he tried to play the Wall Street market, a few years
       later. However, he then moved to St. Louis and was able to build his fortune back in the sketchy bucket
       shops. This fluctuation from rags to riches, and back again, would eventually pave the perpetual cycle
       of Livermore's life.</li>
       <li>He met his first wife, Nettie Jordan, at the age of 23. The pressure of Livermore going broke and
       pawning valuable items for trading money, lead their relationship to it's demise shortly after, in 1917.</li>
       <li>At 24, he was back to riches, after a $10,000 investment in Northern Pacific Railroad returned
       $500,000...... A 5000% gain! The next 7 years saw Livermore turn his fortune into $3 million.</li>
       <li>By 1918, he had built up enough buying power to corner the cotton market, at which point he was
       invited to the White House by President Woodrow Wilson, and asked to sell it back at break even.
       After obliging, and being asked why he did such a thing, Livermore replied, "To see if I could, Mr. President."
       </li>At 40 years old, Livermore married his 2nd wife, Dorothy Fox Wendt, in 1918. They had 2 children, Jesse
       Livermore II, born in 1919, and Paul Livermore, born in 1922.</li>
       <li>During the Wall Street Crash in 1929, by taking a bearish market approach, Livermore's net worth reached $100 
       million.... That's the equivqlent of $14 billion by today's standard. This lead to people believing that
       Livermore himself was responsible for the crash. Death threats ensued, and he had to hire bodyguards.</li>
       <li>By 1932, Dorothy and Livermore were divorced, she retained custody of both children, and recieved a $10 million
       settlement. Their $3.5 million house was sold for $222,000, and torn down.</li>
       <li>In 1933, 56 year old Livermore married a singer named Harriet Metz. They met in Vienaa in 1931, where Harriet
       was performing, and Livermore was on holiday.
       <li>Events leading up to this point had sent him on a spiral of depression, eventually exacerbated by the non-fatal
       shooting of his son, by his wife, in 1935.</li>
       <li>1934 came, and Livermore filed for bankruptcy, after the SEC introduced some new rules which affected his
       trading system.</li>

      </ul>
